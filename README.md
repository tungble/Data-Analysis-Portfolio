## About

Hi, I'm Tung! I have an analytical background in Nutritional Sciences and currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Business Analytics (MS. Business Analytics). I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for leveraging data to discover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the domain of data analytics as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my knowledge and enhance my skill set. Whether collaborating within a team or working independently, I am driven by the excitement of uncovering new findings and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will briefly list data analytics projects describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Bikeshare Rider Volume Forecast
**Code:** Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
