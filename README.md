# Tung Le - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Tung! I have an analytical background in Nutritional Sciences and currently, I am on track to completing my degree in Business Analytics (MS. Business Analytics). I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analytics as an entry-level data analyst.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my knowledge and enhance my skill set. Whether collaborating within a team or working independently, I am driven by the excitement of uncovering new findings and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
